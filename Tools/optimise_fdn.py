"""Search the far reverb's eight delay-line lengths for the flattest tail.

A feedback delay network's late response is a sum of modes at the delay lines' own frequencies and
their combinations. Where those pile up, the tail rings at that pitch: the "colour" of a reverb
that should be colourless. The recent literature optimises the feedback matrix and the gains for
this (Dal Santo, Prawda, Schlecht and Valimaki, DAFx 2023); the cheapest version of the same idea,
and the one this instrument can use without changing its structure, is to choose the lengths.

    python Tools/optimise_fdn.py [--iterations 4000] [--seed 7]

The score is the spread of the simulated tail's third-octave magnitudes in decibels: the smaller,
the flatter. The classic set is measured first as the number to beat, and the winning set is
printed in the form the C++ table wants. It is a search, not a proof: the same seed gives the same
answer, and the number in the source is whatever this printed.
