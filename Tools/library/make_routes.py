"""The twelve routes over the map, written from the library rather than by hand.

A route is a list of waypoints the synth walks by itself, and a waypoint is a preset NAME -- so
every route named presets that a regenerated library no longer has, and eleven of the twelve broke
the moment the built-ins were rebuilt. The names were the only thing holding them; the intent was
never written down anywhere a tool could read.

So it is written down here. Each route says which families it may draw from and what it should feel
like at each stop -- darker, brighter, denser, further out -- and this picks the built-in preset
that fits, preferring one that is FAR on the map from the stop before it, because a route whose
waypoints sit on top of each other is a route that does not travel. Only built-ins are eligible:
a route that named a pack preset would break for anyone without that pack.
